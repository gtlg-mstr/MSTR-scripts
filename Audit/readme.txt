A couple of things to note:

Requires the mstrio-py python module for 11.3.4.1 or higher.
Requires the products.xlsx file (attached) to be in the same folder.
The server details and login details will need to be changed to match your environment that you want to export from.
This output is for all users, across all projects. (allows for filtering to a specific project if need be)
Will output a licenses.xlsx file. I recommend creating a dossier from this using the attribute product and a derived metric to count distinct usernames
Client-reporter privileges is listed under client-web; which is also how PA calculates scenarios.
